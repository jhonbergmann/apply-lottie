## 📅 About

Mobile - Applying Lottie, lottie-react-native is a mobile library for Android and iOS that parses animations from Adobe After Effects exported as JSON with bodymovin and renders them natively on mobile devices! For the first time, designers can create and send beautiful animations without an engineer meticulously recreating them by hand. And react-lottie for ReactJS.
